About Coding from Memory 

Code from Memory is a web based compiler that allows users to input any amount of code and compile it while simultaneously displaying what the code 
is doing behind the scenes. This program helps people overcome a fundamental barrier to learning programming: understanding what happens as the computer 
executes each line of a program's source code. Using this tool, you can write Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++ programs in your Web browser 
and visualize what the computer is doing step-by-step as it executes those programs.
