About Project
Code from Memory is a web based compiler that allows users to input any amount of code and compile it while simultaneously displaying what 
the code is doing behind the scenes. This programÂ helps people overcome a fundamental barrier to learning programming: understanding what 
happens as the computer executes each line of a program's source code. Using this tool, you can write Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++ 
programs in your Web browser and visualize what the computer is doing step-by-step as it executes those programs.
